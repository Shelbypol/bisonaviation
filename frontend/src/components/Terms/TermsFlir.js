                        </span>
                        The “Contract” is the legally binding agreement for Buyer’s purchase of the goods and services
                        (“Goods” and “Services”) Bison will provide Buyer in response to Buyer’s purchase order (the
                        “Purchase Order”). These Terms and Conditions, Bison’s Quotation, if any, and Buyer’s Purchase
                        Order comprise the Contract. Conflicts between and among the terms and conditions of those
                        documents shall be resolved according to the foregoing order of precedence. The Contract states
                        the parties’ entire agreement, superseding prior discussions, correspondence, negotiations and
                        proposals. Buyer’s preprinted terms, including those in Buyer’s Purchase Order, shall not apply
                        to the Contract, and Bison objects to such terms. This Contract shall only be modified in
                        writing and signed by the parties.

                        Bison’s Quotation offer, unless it expressly states otherwise, may be accepted within 30 days of
                        the date of the Quotation, or until Bison withdraws the Quotation, whichever is earlier. The
                        Contract shall become binding when Bison’s authorized representative issues a written
                        confirmation of the Purchase Order.

                        </span>
                        Buyer, in writing, may: (1) make changes to drawings or specifications; (2) make additions to or
                        deletions from quantities ordered; (3) change the delivery schedule; (4) alter the method of
                        shipment or packing; and, (5) change the place of delivery. If any change causes an increase or
                        decrease in the cost of or timing required to provide the Goods or Services, or affects the
                        warranty, Bison shall notify Buyer within ten calendar days after receipt of Buyer’s written
                        change notice. For changes in cost or delivery, an equitable adjustment shall be made in the
                        price or delivery schedule, or both, and the Contract shall be modified in writing. If the
                        parties cannot agree on an equitable adjustment, Bison will not be obligated to accept the
                        proposed change and the Contract shall remain unmodified.

                        </span>
                        Unless expressly stated otherwise in writing by Bison, the Purchase Price excludes all charges
                        and expenses connected to carriage of the Goods to Buyer, and all taxes and customs duties of
                        any kind that either party is required to pay with respect to the sale of Goods and Services
                        covered by this Contract, but includes packing costs. Buyer shall pay Bison in accordance with
                        Bison’s proposal, quotation, and/or order acknowledgement in U.S. funds within 30 days,
                        conditioned on approved credit, after the date of Bison’s invoice. Buyer's submission of its
                        Purchase Order creates an express security agreement, granting Bison a security interest in the
                        Goods, until Buyer pays the entire Purchase Price. Bison may issue its invoice for the purchase
                        price for Goods, upon shipment, and for Services, upon completion. Bison may be entitled to
                        invoice for progress payments as delineated on the face of the proposal or order
                        acknowledgement. If partial shipments are made, Bison may submit its invoice upon each shipment
                        for the portion of the Purchase Price allocated to that shipment. If Buyer is not located in the
                        United States, Buyer shall provide Bison with an acceptable letter of credit in the amount of
                        the Purchase Price, either issued or confirmed by a major U.S. bank, with expiry date 30 days
                        after shipment and partial drawings permissible if agreed to by the parties. Payment under the
                        letter of credit shall be made upon presentation of invoice (for progress payments), or upon
                        presentation of bill of lading or warehouse receipt. If Buyer does not pay Bison on the agreed
                        dates of payment, Buyer shall pay interest to Bison on overdue amounts at a rate of 1% of the
                        unpaid balance monthly. In addition to charging interest on the unpaid balance, Bison may cancel
                        or reschedule delivery of Goods if Buyer is in default of payments or any other material term of
                        this Contract.

                        If Buyer requests in writing on its purchase order, Bison shall provide Buyer at least seven
                        days’ notice of Bison’s final acceptance testing, to enable Buyer to attend such tests. Buyer’s
                        inspection at Bison’s facility shall be limited to standard acceptance tests and shall be at
                        Buyer’s expense. Buyer agrees to comply with Bison’s site rules regarding safety and security.
                        Irrespective of whether Buyer attends acceptance testing, Buyer shall have accepted the Goods
                        irrevocably when Bison certifies that the Goods have passed Bison’s standard acceptance tests.
                        Services shall be accepted upon completion. If tests are made by Buyer to demonstrate the
                        ability of the Goods to operate as specified, Buyer is to make all preparations and incur all
                        expenses incidental to such tests. Bison will have the right of representation at such tests at
                        its expense, and the right to technically direct the operation of the Goods during such tests,
                        including requiring a preliminary run for adjustments. Any defects in material or workmanship
                        shall be repaired under the warranty in Section 8.

                        Bison shall substantially meet quoted delivery dates, which are estimated based on conditions
                        known at the time of quotation. Bison shall not be liable for any nonperformance, loss, damage,
                        or delay due to war, acts of terrorism, riots, fire, flood, strikes or other labor difficulty,
                        governmental actions, including without limit delivery requirements of a US Government agency
                        rated order, acts of God, acts of the Buyer or its customer, transportation delays, inability to

                        control of Bison. In the event of delay in performance due to any such cause, the date of
                        delivery or time for completion will be extended at least by the length of time lost due to such
                        delay. Bison shall not be liable for any damages resulting from any delay in delivery. Bison, at
                        its discretion, reserves the right to deliver early should it deem that the circumstances
                        warrant it.

                        Seller warrants that the Goods, will conform substantially to published specifications and be
                        free from defects in material at Delivery and during the warranty periods defined below, when
                        operated within assume parameters (Warranty). New Goods shall be under warranty for three
                        hundred and sixty-five (365) calendar days, or, in the case of products that measure operational
                        hours of use, one thousand (1000) hours of use if shorter than three hundred sixty-five (365)
                        days. Seller warrants repairs and spare or replacement parts manufactured by Seller for either
                        six months from Delivery, except with respect to the products that measure operational hours,
                        where the period shall be the shorter of six months or five hundred (500) hours of use. Buyer
                        shall provide Warranty claims to Seller in writing promptly upon discovery and within the
                        warranty period. Seller, at its sole option, will repair or replace the Goods, in whole or in
                        part, Seller’s designated service center (Remedy). Buyer shall pay the costs of sending the
                        Goods to Seller’s designated service center. BUYER will pay the costs of returning Goods to
                        Buyer. The turnaround time on repairs will be commercially reasonable. If Buyer so requests in
                        the Order, Seller will state in the Acknowledgement, Seller’s then current average Remedy
                        turnaround period. The Remedy is Seller's sole obligation and Buyer's sole and exclusive remedy
                        for all warranty on Goods (Remedy), except that, if the Remedy were ever adjudicated
                        insufficient, Buyer may receive a refund the Price as Buyer’s exclusive remedy instead.
                        Warranties do not extend to Goods repaired or modified without Seller’s written consent. Please
                        note that the operating specifications of Goods may vary from the published specification for
                        Goods, depending on: application specific factors, including without limit, installation

                        Goods shall be deemed defective by reason of normal wear and tear, impact of Variables, or
                        Buyer's failure to properly store, install, operate, or maintain the Goods in accordance with
                        good industry practices or specific recommendations or instructions of Seller SELLER MAKES NO

                        arising from a breach of this Section 10. The aforementioned provisions shall in no way be
                        considered to abridge, supplant or otherwise limit other legal or equitable remedies available
                        to Bison for such breaches, and Bison may seek redress for such breaches to the fullest extent
                        allowable by law. The obligations in this Section 10 shall survive termination of this
                        Agreement.

                          11. PATENT INDEMNITY.  &nbsp;
                        </span>
                        If the Goods sold hereunder are to be prepared or manufactured according to Buyer’s
                        specifications, Buyer shall indemnify Bison and hold it harmless from any claims or liability
                        for patent or trademark infringement on account of the sale of such equipment. Bison agrees at
                        its expense to defend any suit alleging direct infringement instituted against Buyer (but not
                        subsidiaries or customers of Buyer) and indemnify Buyer against any award of damages and costs
                        for direct infringement made against Buyer by a court of last resort to the extent that the
                        damages award is based on a final determination that the Goods as and when furnished by Bison to
                        Buyer directly infringed any U.S. patent, trademark or copyright. Indemnification of costs under
                        this provision shall extend only to actual costs assessed. The indemnity obligations in this
                        section do not apply to Goods made or modified to Buyer’s specifications, and are expressly
                        conditioned upon: (a) Buyer providing Bison with written notice promptly, and in any event no
                        later than ten days’ from Buyer’s receipt of notice, of such claim; (b) Bison shall have the
                        option of having sole control of the defense against such claims and the negotiation for their
                        settlement; (c) Buyer cooperating with Bison in the defense and negotiations relating to the
                        claims; and, (d) if Bison determines that the Goods are or are likely to be the subject of
                        direct infringement claims, Buyer permitting Bison to obtain the right for Buyer to keep using
                        the Goods, or obtain substitute goods, or modify the Goods to be noninfringing, or refund the
                        price. The indemnity obligations stated in this section shall not apply if the infringement
                        claims result from: (a) Buyer or Buyer’s customer altering the Goods; (b) use of the Goods in a
                        manner neither intended nor contemplated at the time of the sale; or, (c) Buyer’s failure to use
                        a modified or substitute good provided by Bison pursuant to this section. These warranties are
                        in lieu of all other warranties, express or implied with regard to any claim of infringement.
                        ANY WARRANTY AGAINST INFRINGEMENT THAT MAY BE PROVIDED UNDER THE UNIFORM COMMERCIAL CODE AND/OR
                        ANY OTHER COMPARABLE STATE STATUTE IS EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMED.

                        </span>
                        Bison shall in no event be liable for any consequential, incidental, indirect, special or
                        punitive damages arising out of the Contract, or out of any breach of any of its obligations
                        hereunder, or out of any defect in, or failure of, or malfunction of the Goods or Services,
                        including but not limited to, claims based upon loss of use, lost profits or revenue, interest,
                        lost goodwill, work stoppage, impairment of other equipment, environmental damage, loss by
                        reason of shutdown or non- operation, increased expenses of operation, cost of purchase of
                        replacement equipment, or claims of Buyer or customers of Buyer for service interruption whether
                        or not such loss or damage is based on contract, tort (including negligence and strict
                        liability) or otherwise. Bison’s maximum liability under or in any way relating to this Contract
                        shall not exceed the Purchase Order price for the Goods or Services upon which such liability is
                        based. All such liability shall terminate one year from the date of delivery of the Goods, if
                        not sooner terminated.

                        shall be adjudicated exclusively in Bexar County, Texas, in any court of competent jurisdiction.
                        This Contract is expressly conditioned on the
                        exclusion of the application of the United Nations Convention on the International Sale of
                        Goods.

                        Buyer shall have the right to cancel the Contract upon
                        30 days’ prior written notice to Bison, and Bison shall stop performance upon the receipt of
                        such notice. If the order canceled is for a standard commercial product, Buyer shall pay Bison
                        25% of the Purchase Price. If the order canceled is for a custom product, Buyer shall pay: (a)
                        the agreed unit price for equipment or components completed and delivered; (b) additional
                        material and labor costs incurred; (c) engineering services for the canceled items, which shall
                        not exceed the contract price for such items; and (d) such other costs and expenses, including
                        cancellation charges under Bison’s subcontracts, if any. Buyer’s obligations under paragraphs 4,
                        9, 10, 11 and 12 shall survive termination of this Contract.

                        The Goods are subject to U.S. Government export laws and regulations. Buyer shall not export,

                        obtaining the appropriate US Government approvals. Bison will cooperate with Buyer to obtain any
                        export licenses Buyer seeks, but obtaining such licensing shall be the exclusive responsibility
                        of Buyer and Bison makes no representation or warranty regarding the issuance of export licenses
                        for the Goods.

                        If Seller provides restricted software with the Goods, that restricted software is proprietary to Seller or Seller’s suppliers. Seller grants Buyer a nonexclusive, perpetual license to use the software only on and in conjunction with the Goods. Buyer agrees that title remains with Seller (and its suppliers, if any) and Buyer shall not disassemble, decode, or translate the software, or copy or modify the software except for archival or back-up purposes as necessary for use on and with the Goods. Buyer will maintain all proprietary marks on software provided by Seller. Buyer may transfer this license if transferring the Goods also and if the transferee agrees to comply with the restrictions of this license. Upon such transfer, Buyer’s license terminates and Buyer shall destroy all copies of the software and related documentation in Buyer’s possession.

                        When Buyer is a prime contractor or a subcontractor at a higher tier than Bison for a U.S. Government prime contract, applicable Federal Acquisition Regulations and Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement clauses (collectively, FAR Clauses) may be incorporated into this Contract only if there are other FAR clauses that make the subject incorporation in this Contract mandatory. Bison expressly rejects the incorporation of any FAR Clauses that do not meet the foregoing condition. In all incorporated FAR Clauses, the terms “Government” and “Contractor” shall be revised to identify properly the contracting parties under this Contract and effect the proper intent of the clause. Except with respect to termination for Bison’s default, Buyer shall exercise an incorporated FAR Clause against Bison only if, and to the extent that, the subject FAR Clause is exercised against the Buyer by Buyer’s customer.
