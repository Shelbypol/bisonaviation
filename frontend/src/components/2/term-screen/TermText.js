                        The person signing this agreement (“customer”) has actual authority, as owner of the aircraft or authorized agent for the owner of the aircraft, to authorize Bison Aviation to undertake and perform all repair services requested, contemplated, or deemed necessary for the aircraft, as determined by the work proposal attached hereto. When applicable, all references to customer noted in this contract include the owner of the aircraft.

                        Repair services include, but are not limited to, the furnishing of labor, parts, materials, components, appliances, and supplies for the purpose of repairing, restoring, replacing or upgrading the component or aircraft and any items located thereon or attached thereto. Repair services do not include freight charges, fuel or flight costs, and any applicable government taxes or fees, which may also become due and payable. The customer will be required to provide Bison Aviation such information as date of installation, hours in service as reflected in aircraft log book, nature of defect and any other information to allow Bison Aviation the opportunity to meet vendor’s warranty requirements.

                            Right of Possession: &nbsp;
                        </span>
                        Bison Aviation is entitled to payment for all repair services performed on the component or the aircraft. Until such time as the total amounts owed have been paid, Bison Aviation has a right to maintain possession of the component and aircraft and all original logbooks associated therewith. Upon full payment for all repair services performed on the component or aircraft, Bison Aviation shall release the aircraft and its accompanying original logbooks to the customer or any other person so designated, in writing, by the owner of the aircraft. For purposes of this section, the owner of the aircraft is to be determined by reference to the most recently recorded Bill of Sale on file with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) registry whether it be an individual or entity. Unless otherwise agreed upon in writing, payment for repair services are due and payable upon demand. If payment in good funds is not tendered to Bison Aviation within ninety (90) days from the time that fees for repair services become due and payable, Bison Aviation is entitled to file and record a mechanic’s lien for payments due, which may be enforced in accordance with applicable state statutes. This contract is in no way intended to waive the application of state’s lien statutes. Bison Aviation is not liable for any damages caused by delay in returning the aircraft to service and customer specifically waives any claim to damages of any and all types arising from delay in returning the aircraft to service.

                        If, prior to the time that full payment for repair services has been made, Bison Aviation elects, in its sole and exclusive discretion, to release possession of the aircraft or component, the parties mutually agree that this release of possession constitutes a good and valuable benefit in favor of the customer. For consideration of this benefit, the parties mutually agree that the customer knowingly and intentionally waives any right to contest the validity of any mechanic’s lien recorded pursuant to state law due to Bison Aviation’s failure to have actual possession of the aircraft at that time. Regardless of whether Bison Aviation relinquishes possession of the aircraft prior to receipt of full payment for repair services, Bison Aviation is entitled to maintain possession of the original aircraft and/or component logbooks until such time as full payment is received.

                        In the event that Bison Aviation is required to maintain possession of the aircraft due to nonpayment of repair services, Bison Aviation is entitled to collect a fee for hangar storage or storage equal to that amount Bison Aviation customarily charges for storage of an aircraft or component of similar type, commencing upon default of the demand for amounts due and owing. Bison Aviation shall thereafter be entitled to maintain and enforce a lien for hangar rent or storage in accordance with applicable state Statutes.

                        No bailment is created by Bison Aviation’s possession of the aircraft. The customer bears the risk of loss of the aircraft or component due to unforeseen hazards or events. Bison Aviation shall not be liable for any failure to perform repair services due to causes beyond its control, including but not limited to strikes, lockouts or other labor difficulties, machinery breakdowns, inability to obtain transportation, delays of carriers or suppliers, fires, floods, acts of God, acts of terrorism, war or other outbreaks of hostilities, and any foreign or domestic embargoes. Under no circumstances shall either party be liable to the other party for indirect, consequential, special, or exemplary damages, whether in contract or tort (including strict liability and negligence) such as, but not limited to, loss of use or diminution in value.
